  # PLSC 504 - "Topics in Political Methodology" - Fall 2024

This is the github repo for the Fall 2024 instance of PLSC 504: "Topics in Political Methodology." The course is the "proseminar" in statistical / quantitative methods in the Ph.D. program in political science at Penn State. As such, it is geared toward breadth rather than depth. The course is a (re)introduction to generalized linear models, Bayesian statistics, models for sample selection, causal inference with observational data, survival analysis, time series models, regression models for panel / time-series cross-sectional data, basic multivariate statistics, item response theory, network analysis, and basic text analysis.

The repo contains (or will contain) all course materials, including the syllabus, most course readings, slides, example data, computer code, and homework exercises. It also contains example materials for constructing a research poster presentation using LaTeX.
